# University-Finder
This website is a submission assignment for the "Learning Fundamentals of Front-End Web Development" class. The assignment focuses on creating web applications using ES6, Custom Elements, NPM, Module Bundler, and AJAX. On this website, you can discover university data from around the world by utilizing an API. I am currently enrolled in this class.
